Vision code from 2019 Destination: Deep Space. The script (`vision_2019.py`) publishes lateral and distance offsets to the centermost vision target in frame. The code may need to be calibrated using `calibrate_focal_length` in the two-visible-target case (use the resulting value to update the `FOCAL_LENGTH` constant). The `simple-opencv` branch contains an alternative implementation of this script where the vision window does not always remain frontmost on Windows.
