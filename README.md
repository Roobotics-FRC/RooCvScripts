# RooCvScripts
This repository contains Python scripts for vision processing and image streaming that use OpenCV and run on the drive laptop. Vision scripts compute an angle offset to the target and feed that value via NetworkTables to the robot. This repo contains vision code for 2019 (Destination: Deep Space) and the 2017 offseason.

PID values are tuned for turning as of 10/17 and work with RooBotPost2017. The 2017 code works with several commands from RoobotPost2017.
